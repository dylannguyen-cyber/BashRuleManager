# BashRuleManager
This is a Bash Rule Manager script for the user story task: As a Bash Learner, I will learn bash scripting for command-line argument parsing, case statements, and file manipulation by creating a simple rule manager. This will be essential for the CyberCafe project because we will need a manager to manage config. files and obtain daemon behavior.
